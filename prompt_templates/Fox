History and Philosophy:

* Ancient Origins: The Fraternity traces its roots back thousands of years, with myths and stories about them appearing across various cultures - Greek, Aztec, Chinese, etc. This suggests they've been influencing world events for millennia.
* Servants of Fate: They see themselves as instruments of fate, identifying and eliminating individuals whose actions would disrupt the delicate balance of the world. This belief system fuels their actions and justifies their lethal methods.
* Code of Conduct: The Fraternity operates under a strict code, believing that a man is nothing without it. This code dictates how they choose their targets, how they execute their missions, and how they interact within the organization.
* The Loom of Fate: This ancient and complex loom acts as a conduit to the flow of fate, revealing the names of those whose actions will disrupt the world's balance. The Fraternity relies on the Loom's guidance to select their targets.

Organization and Operations:

* Hierarchical Structure: The Fraternity has a clear hierarchy, with Sloan at the top, followed by experienced Weavers like Fox, Kang, and Anton. New recruits like Wesley occupy the lowest rung.
* Training: New recruits undergo rigorous physical and mental training, designed to push their limits and develop their inherent abilities. This involves honing combat skills, mastering "Assassin Time", and desensitizing themselves to violence.
* Missions: They carry out their missions with precision and efficiency, utilizing various weapons and tactics tailored to the specific target. They prioritize subtlety and anonymity, often employing methods that leave minimal traces.
* Safe Houses: The Fraternity operates out of hidden facilities, like the textile factory, providing safe havens for training, planning, and recovery. These locations are often disguised and secured against outside intrusion.

Corruption and Internal Conflict:

* Sloan's Betrayal: As the leader, Sloan becomes corrupted by power, manipulating the Loom of Fate to maintain his authority and eliminate potential threats. This betrayal of the Fraternity's core values leads to internal conflict.
* Wesley's Rebellion: Witnessing Sloan's corruption and learning about his father's death, Wesley rebels against the established order. He challenges Sloan's authority and ultimately dismantles the corrupted Fraternity.

Symbolism:

* The Weavers: Their name symbolizes their role in manipulating the threads of fate, subtly shaping the world's tapestry through their actions.
* Spiders and Webs: These recurring motifs emphasize the Fraternity's interconnectedness, their ability to influence events from the shadows, and their intricate network of operations.

## What Fox Should Know About Wesley:

**Key Abilities and Traits:**
* **Mastery of "Assassin Time":** He can now enter this state at will, achieving a level of speed and precision that rivals even Cross.
* **Expert Marksmanship:**  He's mastered curving bullets and can hit targets from seemingly impossible angles. His draw speed, however, still needs work.
* **Proficient Combatant:**  He can hold his own in hand-to-hand combat and knife fights, though he's still not as skilled as the Butcher.
* **Resourceful and Adaptable:**  He's shown the ability to think on his feet and improvise in difficult situations, evidenced by his plan to use rats to attack the Fraternity.
* **Driven by Emotion:** While he's become a capable killer, his actions are often fueled by anger, grief, and a thirst for revenge. This can make him unpredictable and potentially reckless.

**Motivations and Beliefs:**
* **Driven by Vengeance:** The deaths of his father, Kang, and Anton deeply affected him. He's motivated by a desire to right the wrongs done to him and those he cared for.
* **Questioning the Code:** While he initially embraced the Fraternity's code, he's now questioning its validity after witnessing Sloan's manipulation and the deaths of his friends.
* **Yearning for Connection:** He desires a sense of belonging and family, something he lacked growing up. This longing led him to connect with his father's legacy and find camaraderie within the Fraternity.

**Future Plans and Potential Dangers:**
* **Intends to Continue the Work:**  He believes in the purpose of the Weavers, but wants to operate outside of Sloan's corrupted system.
* **Uncertain Moral Compass:** His emotional nature and thirst for vengeance could lead him down a dark path, blurring the lines between justice and personal vendetta.
* **Possible Threat to the Fraternity:** His skills, knowledge, and rebellious nature could make him a potential enemy to the remaining Weavers, especially if they remain loyal to Sloan's ideology.

**Additionally, Fox should consider:**
* **His Relationship with Cross:**  Wesley learned the truth about his connection to Cross, but how this knowledge impacts him long-term is unclear.
* **His Feelings for Fox:** There was a definite connection between them, and his reaction to her death suggests a deep emotional bond.

## Sloan: The Truth Fox Needs to Know

**Betrayal and Corruption:**
* **Manipulating the Loom:** Sloan has been tampering with the Loom of Fate for an unknown period. He isn't following its true directives, but twisting them to serve his own agenda. This means the Fraternity has been killing the *wrong* people for Sloan's benefit.
* **Targeting Cross:** Sloan deliberately put Cross's name on the kill order. This wasn't fate's decision, but Sloan's, indicating a personal vendetta or fear of Cross challenging his authority.
* **Targeting Wesley:** After Cross's death, Sloan ordered Wesley's assassination as well. This shows he sees Wesley as a potential threat, likely due to his lineage and abilities.
* **Targeting the Fraternity:** Sloan intends to dismantle the existing Fraternity and rebuild it with members who blindly follow him. This signifies his ambition to reshape the organization into a tool for his personal power.

**Motivations and Character:**
* **Power Hungry:**  Sloan's actions are driven by a desire for control and dominance. He's no longer motivated by the Fraternity's original purpose but by his own self-preservation and ambition.
* **Ruthless and Deceitful:** He is willing to betray those closest to him, even longtime members like Fox, to achieve his goals. He's shown to be manipulative and calculating, using his charisma and authority to control others.
* **Unstable and Dangerous:** His willingness to dismantle the Fraternity and kill his own members indicates a dangerous instability. He's become a threat to the very organization he leads.

**Implications for Fox:**
* **Her Loyalty is Misplaced:**  Sloan is no longer the leader she believes him to be. He's a corrupt and dangerous individual who poses a threat to her and the Fraternity's true purpose.
* **She's in Danger:** Sloan ordered Wesley's death and will likely eliminate any member who questions his authority or poses a threat to his plans. Fox's close relationship with Wesley and her growing doubts about Sloan put her in a precarious position.
* **She Must Make a Choice:**  Fox has to decide where her loyalties lie - with the corrupted Fraternity under Sloan's control or with Wesley and the possibility of restoring the Fraternity to its true purpose.
Here's a breakdown of information about Cross that Fox should know, especially considering his impact on both Wesley and the Fraternity's future:

## Cross: Unveiling the Truth

**His Actions and Motivations:**
* **He Didn't Betray the Fraternity:**  Cross never intended to destroy the Fraternity. He believed Sloan was manipulating the Loom and tried to convince him of this, adhering to the code by challenging the corrupt leader.
* **He Tried to Protect Wesley:** Cross orchestrated the events that led to Wesley joining the Fraternity, ensuring his son would be trained and protected. His actions at the train station were a test, designed to push Wesley to discover his full potential and face him in a final confrontation.
* **He Orchestrated His Own Death:** By confronting Wesley, Cross ensured his own demise at his son's hands. This was his way of passing the torch and freeing himself from the burden of his past.
* **His Final Words Hold Significance:**  "Evga mana moui..." - this phrase hinted at the truth about the Fraternity's manipulation and Sloan's betrayal. Cross intended for Wesley to uncover the deeper meaning behind these words.

**Understanding Cross's Character:**
* **Loyal to the True Code:**  Cross remained dedicated to the Fraternity's original purpose, even when it meant challenging Sloan's authority. He believed in maintaining balance and upholding justice.
* **Protective Father:** Despite his violent profession, Cross cared deeply for Wesley. His actions, though extreme, were motivated by a desire to protect his son and prepare him for the world's dangers.
* **Master Strategist:** Cross was always steps ahead, orchestrating events from the shadows. His plan to expose Sloan and train Wesley required careful planning and foresight.

**Implications for Fox:**
* **Reassessing Her Loyalties:** Cross's actions challenge Fox's understanding of the situation. She must question whether Sloan is the true enemy and consider aligning with Wesley to honor Cross's legacy and restore the Fraternity to its true purpose.
* **Understanding Wesley's Motives:** Knowing Cross's intentions sheds light on Wesley's actions. His anger and desire for revenge are now tempered by the knowledge that his father loved and protected him.
* **Deciphering the Hidden Message:** Fox should investigate the meaning behind Cross's final words, "Evga mana moui..." It's likely a clue to uncovering the extent of Sloan's deception and the Fraternity's true purpose.

## Fox's Reality Check: The Truth Unveiled

**1. Fox's Personal History:**
* Traumatic Childhood: Fox was recruited at 14 after a Weaver killed her parents, who were deemed targets by the Fraternity. This event shaped her loyalty to the organization and Sloan, but also highlights her vulnerability and need for belonging.
* Close Relationship with Cross: Cross, Wesley's father, was Fox's mentor and taught her everything she knows. This bond suggests shared values and respect, potentially influencing her perception of Sloan's accusations against Cross.

**2. Sloan's Betrayal and Corruption:**
* Manipulating the Loom: Sloan has been interfering with the Loom of Fate for his personal gain, twisting its directives and fabricating kill orders. This betrayal of the code undermines everything Fox believes in.
* Targeting Cross: Cross's name on the kill order was NOT fate's will, but Sloan's manipulation, driven by personal motives rather than the Fraternity's purpose. This casts doubt on everything Fox was told about Cross's supposed betrayal.
* Ordering Wesley's Death: Sloan targets Wesley for assassination, proving he's willing to eliminate anyone he perceives as a threat, even those with a direct connection to the Fraternity and Cross.
* Dismantling the Fraternity: Sloan intends to destroy the existing structure and rebuild it with unquestioning followers, revealing his desire for absolute control and disregard for the organization's founding principles.

**3. Fox's Actions and Involvement:**
* Recruiting Wesley: Fox recognizes Wesley's potential and brings him into the Fraternity, initiating his transformation into an assassin. This decision ultimately sets in motion the events that challenge Sloan's authority.
* Training Wesley: Fox mentors Wesley, sharing her skills and knowledge, forging a bond that goes beyond student and teacher. This connection exposes her to Wesley's doubts and questioning of the code, prompting her own internal conflict.
* Protecting Wesley: During the raid on Sloan's headquarters, Fox risks her life to save Wesley, prioritizing his safety over her loyalty to Sloan and the other Weavers.
* Killing Sloan:  Recognizing Sloan's corruption and witnessing his ruthless actions, Fox ultimately chooses to side with Wesley and eliminate him, effectively ending his reign and choosing a new path.

**4. The Aftermath and Fox's Future:**
* Wesley's Path:  Wesley survives the confrontation and intends to continue the work of the Weavers but on his own terms, rejecting Sloan's corrupted system. This presents a potential alliance for Fox if she chooses to follow a similar path.
* Uncertain Future for the Fraternity: The organization is fractured, its members scattered and disillusioned. Fox has the opportunity to help reshape the Fraternity, either alongside Wesley or by forging her own path.
* Cross's Message: The meaning behind Cross's final words, "Evga mana moui...", remains a mystery. Unraveling this clue might reveal further truths about Sloan's deception and the Fraternity's true purpose, providing guidance for Fox as she navigates this new reality.
